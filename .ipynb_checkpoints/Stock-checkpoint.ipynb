    "This example employs several unsupervised learning techniques to extract\n",
    "the stock market structure from variations in historical quotes.\n",
    "\n",

    "Learning a graph structure\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We use sparse inverse covariance estimation to find which quotes are\n",
    "correlated conditionally on the others. Specifically, sparse inverse\n",
    "covariance gives us a graph, that is a list of connection. For each\n",
    "symbol, the symbols that it is connected too are those useful to explain\n",
    "its fluctuations.\n",

    "Clustering\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "We use clustering to group together quotes that behave similarly. Here,\n",
    "amongst the :ref:`various clustering techniques <clustering>` available\n",
    "in the scikit-learn, we use :ref:`affinity_propagation` as it does\n",
    "not enforce equal-size clusters, and it can choose automatically the\n",
    "number of clusters from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this gives us a different indication than the graph, as the\n",
    "graph reflects conditional relations between variables, while the\n",
    "clustering reflects marginal properties: variables clustered together can\n",
    "be considered as having a similar impact at the level of the full stock\n",
    "market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding in 2D space\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualization purposes, we need to lay out the different symbols on a\n",
    "2D canvas. For this we use :ref:`manifold` techniques to retrieve 2D\n",
    "embedding.\n",

    "The output of the 3 models are combined in a 2D graph where nodes\n",

    "\n",
    "- cluster labels are used to define the color of the nodes\n",
    "- the sparse covariance model is used to display the strength of the edges\n",
    "- the 2D embedding is used to position the nodes in the plan\n",
    "\n",
    "This example has a fair amount of visualization-related code, as\n",
    "visualization is crucial here to display the graph. One of the challenge\n",
    "is to position the labels minimizing overlap. For this we use an\n",

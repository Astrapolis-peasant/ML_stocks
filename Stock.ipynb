    "We use sparse inverse covariance estimation to find which quotes are\n",
    "correlated conditionally on the others. Specifically, sparse inverse\n",
    "covariance gives us a graph, that is a list of connection. For each\n",

    "\n",
    "We use clustering to group together quotes that behave similarly. Here,\n",
    "amongst the :ref:`various clustering techniques <clustering>` available\n",
    "in the scikit-learn, we use :ref:`affinity_propagation` as it does\n",
    "not enforce equal-size clusters, and it can choose automatically the\n",
    "number of clusters from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this gives us a different indication than the graph, as the\n",
    "graph reflects conditional relations between variables, while the\n",
    "clustering reflects marginal properties: variables clustered together can\n",
    "be considered as having a similar impact at the level of the full stock\n",

    "---------------------\n",

    "For visualization purposes, we need to lay out the different symbols on a\n",
